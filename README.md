Objective
In this checkpoint, we are going to use what we have learned so far to play around with some React components and JSX.


Instructions

 ·        Create a project using create-react-app

·        Create App.js in the src folder and use it as a root component for your React app.

·        Create a file called product.js with a json object of a product’s name, price, description, and a path or URL to an image. (Don’t forget to export the json object)

·        Create four components that return the product’s name, price, description, and image. (Name.js, Price.js, Description.js, and Image.js)

·        Export all your components so that they can be used in the root component (in App.js)

·        Import the json object created previously into all newly created components.

·        Create a card that contains all components created using react-bootstrap in your App.js.

·        Display a message below the card that says Hello, then your first name, or if you didn’t yet provide your first name, display “Hello, there!” (You can provide your name as a variable above the root component)

·        Display an image if the first name is provided.

·        Be creative as much as possible with your styling!

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
